#####  A light-weight, highly performant PHP data access library. https://travis-ci.org/rotexsoft/leanorm/builds ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rotexsoft/leanorm.svg?branch=master)

See http://rotexsoft.github.io/file-renderer/ for documentation.


This is not a full-blown template library (like twig, plates-php, etc).
It is up to the users of this class to make sure the data passed to the renderer has been validated / sanitized.
