##### A tool for rendering PHP files that are meant to generate output. Easy to use as a view component in an MVC framework. https://travis-ci.org/rotexsoft/leanorm/builds ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rotexsoft/leanorm.svg?branch=master)

WILL RESUME ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT IN JULY 2016.

This is a simple, elegant and flexible tool that can be used to render php files.

It provides escaping functionality.

It is designed to be un-obtrusive, your view files can easily be used with a different rendering or templating library.
You do not need to learn any new syntax (or markup / templating language) in order to compose your view. Just write your views in plain old php.

This is not a full-blown template library (like twig, plates-php, etc).
It is up to the users of this class to make sure the data passed to the renderer has been validated / sanitized.
