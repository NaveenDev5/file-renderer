##### A tool for rendering PHP files that are meant to generate output. Easy to use as a view component in an MVC framework. https://travis-ci.org/rotexsoft/leanorm/builds ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rotexsoft/leanorm.svg?branch=master)

See http://rotexsoft.github.io/file-renderer/ for documentation.

This is not a full-blown template library (like twig, plates-php, etc).
It is up to the users of this class to make sure the data passed to the renderer has been validated / sanitized.
